# FOWDR

`fowdr` is a Python package for computing the dispersion relations (DRs) of the fast flavor oscillation waves in the dense neutrino gases that satisfy the following conditions. 

To install, please type the following command in a terminal:  
`python3 -m pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/mikeduan/fowdr.git`

Please see `fowdr.ipynb` (or `fowdr.pdf` if you don't use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org)) under `doc` for how to use this package.
